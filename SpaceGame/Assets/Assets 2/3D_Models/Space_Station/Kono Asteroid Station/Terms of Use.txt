Terms of Use


* Almost all my models have attached a document for "terms of use". Some of these documents are old so you should check my blog for the latest (updated) "terms of use" !

* All models are made by "SolCommand" from http://solcommand.blogspot.com/

* You can use my available free stuff for any personal and commercial project that you want and it would be appreciated if you'd send me an email with some info on your project as I'm always curious on who uses my models and how.

* You can edit my models however you like (rename, retexture, edit the mesh, etc.) without having to ask for my approval, just don't claim them as your own when you're done.

* If you notice errors with a model pls let me know so I'd try to fix it.

* If you feel like giving something in return for the models, you can always push the "Donate" button from my blog and buy me a coffee, a beer or a Ferrari.

* If you need an easy and fast model send me a message with details and I'll let you know asap if we can work something out or not.

* That's about it, enjoy my stuff and remember people, make Love not War ! :)
